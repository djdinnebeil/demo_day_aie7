Who was JAMES BLAINE WALKER and what was his role in relation to rapid wartime industrial mobilization?,"['INTRODUCTION BY JAMES BLAINE WALKER Secretary Public Service Commission, 1st Dist. New York; Author of ""Fifty Years of Rapid Transit,"" etc. FOR MANY YEARS travelers on the Pennsylvania Railroad, between Philadelphia and Atlantic City, have viewed from the car windows apparently interminable stretches of flat, sandy country covered with a thick growth of scrub oak, small pine trees and a dense undergrowth of brush. Many have speculated as to what practical use this great stretch of land, useless in its present state for agricultural purposes and yet most advantageously located, could be devoted. Quite unexpectedly the necessities of war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil was easily worked and there was available a subterranean supply of excellent water readily tapped by driving wells. The moderate, healthful and equable climate was also suitable for a large industrial community. Early in the year 1918 the Company acquired for the Government a tract of 6000 acres of this land lying near the town of Hammonton, New Jersey. The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement. The history of the work is a story of the accomplishment of brain power, engineering talent and the genius of American business organization, which reflects the highest credit upon all concerned. The leaders in the formation of the Atlantic Loading Company were O. J. Salisbury, of Salt Lake City, Utah, J. D. Evans, of the Evans Engineering Corporation, and the Electric Bond and Share Company, of New York, both of whom have had extensive experience in the financing and construction of large works. The new Company was formed by taking the pick of men from several large organizations, including that of the Electric Bond and Share Company, so that each of its men was made up of experts. This method of selecting suitable men was followed throughout the organization, the financial and administrative chiefs as well as the engineers being picked men. The new organization having in its personnel many of the pioneers in the quantity loading of high explosive shell, embodied in its plant at Amatol the best, most economical and safest methods which could be devised for facilitating and speeding up production. Some of these methods were developed by the Company\'s own engineers: the power belt conveyor system, which permits the continuous movement of shell through the various operations within the central loading building, is one feature. The men placed in charge of operating the plant thus brought to the work at Amatol the skill necessary to successful operation. The speed with which the call of the Government was met, the co-ordination of plant and men and the results obtained which provided for every contingency stand out as prominent features of the work.']","JAMES BLAINE WALKER was the Secretary of the Public Service Commission for the 1st District of New York and the author of ""Fifty Years of Rapid Transit.""",single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer
Who was Mr. Hammel and what role did he play in the context of wartime industrial development during World War I?,"[""In the following pages Mr. Hammel, the Company's Chief Engineer, and a Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, has creditably presented an all-too-brief history of this great undertaking, which includes an interesting description of the plant and the town, their construction, operation, capacity, and the efficient organization which made them possible. It is eminently fitting that a permanent record should be made of the achievements of the Company, which may well be proud of its work, for success never attended a larger undertaking initiated and carried through in such a short time and in the face of so many difficulties.

Y. M. C. A. what is it?,"['with drying apparatus, as well as a diet kitchen, infirmary and shower. It would, indeed, be difficult to design a building better suited to its purposes, comfortable in its construction and within its walls all the accessories for the proper housing of its occupants. This building, affording living facilities for 150 girls, may well be termed a model of its class. All dormitory buildings have complete toilet arrangements and showers. The bunkhouses also are fully equipped in this respect. Many have telephone service, which connect with all offices, mess halls, dormitories, etc. Of the various mess halls, the largest, the general mess hall, has a seating capacity of 800 in each wing, or 1,600 in all. In it, 6,000 people can be served in an hour. The staff mess hall, with a seating capacity of 450, has served 700 persons at one meal, the service being on the cafeteria system. The houses are of three general classes—single residences, workmen\'s houses and multiple-type houses. The residences have from six to nine rooms, the workmen\'s houses from two to five rooms, and the multiple houses from four to six rooms. All are steam-heated, underdrained and have modern toilet arrangements, including shower baths. Other types, varying in the number of rooms from four to eight, are projected. The general office building, 200 feet in length, has 32 offices. Adjacent to it are the various other town administration buildings. One projected group of buildings, some completed, others moving towards completion, is a Y. M. C. A. unit, including swimming pool, gymnasium with stage, bowling alley, billiard rooms and refreshment and lounging rooms. While the general residence section centers about Liberty Court, with its commercial shops and its commodious theatre, the offices occupy an area by themselves. Building Methods and Comfort The method of construction of the buildings is, generally speaking, cement stucco on a composite metal lath, sometimes called ""brick lath."" This lath is a mesh of steel wire, upon which brick clay has been pressed and baked so as to enclose the wire in brick or terra cotta while leaving the fabric flexible. It comes rolled in strips 40 inches in width and 16 feet in length. In the wall construction, the composite lath is nailed to the studding, which has previously been covered with a layer of weatherproof paper. The lath is then covered with stucco in the regular manner and the surface is finished. This wall construction gives an air space of four inches which provides effective insulation, making the buildings warmer in winter and cooler in summer. The interior partitions are plaster curtain walls, and, while their thickness is but 1½ inches, they have the necessary strength and the advantages of the standard wood partition. This means a saving of all studding and more floor room, giving a very great advantage in both economy and speed. Female Employment and Morale One significant indication of the wisdom of building in a way to satisfy the standards of living of employees is given by the records of female employment. In the earliest stages of construction, when the housing conditions were limited and incomplete, the turnover of help among the women was considerably greater than it became when the dormitories were completed and equipped and the various phases of welfare work, such as recreation and entertainment, were fully organized. Indeed, through all departments the morale of the employees steadily improved and production quickened with the advancing improvement in living conditions until both reached the highest stage with the completion of housing quarters and facilities.']","The Y.

How did the company town and community development of Amatol relate to its town planning and the safety measures implemented during its construction?,"['<1-hop>\n\nAmatol: A former World War I munitions factory, located in Mullica Township, NJ The Book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. (150 scanned pages) is a rare, oversize book that documented the building of a bomb making facility at the tail end of World War I. Amatol was an extensive and attractive ""company town"" to support the ordnance facility. That town of 10,000 disappeared very quickly. However, unlike so many New Jersey ""ghost towns"", this one was fully documented by the company that built it. For anyone familiar with the site Amatol, and later, the wood board Atlantic City Speedway occupied, it is a shock to learn that there had been a large ammunition plant and a supporting town on land that is now covered by mature forest. The only remaining building on the site is the former barracks for the New Jersey State Police located on the White Horse Pike. The people who developed the facility, the factories and storage plants and the town itself comes to life through beautiful photographs in the book and on post-cards capturing a forgotten time. Even though it was a well-produced book, the enthusiasm of readers who have discovered the book has taken their toll on the book. It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life The United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site: ""Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood."" Construction Construction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized.', '<2-hop>\n\nThe Plant Amatol was designed to load a whole series of shells. These ranged from 75 mm projectiles to hand grenades. The steel components were brought in by rail and distributed to a series of facilities designated to the loading of specific ordnance. In the book there is a photographic description of each one of these plants. There are also plans for the various buildings and for each plant which indicate the rail and conveyor connections among the buildings of the plant. These are the 75-mm plant, 4.7 inch plant, 6 inch plants, 8 inch plant, hand grenade plant, booster plant, and rifle grenade plant. Amatol was a great example of the newly emerging discipline of industrial organization. Though no direct attribution in given in the book to specific theorists of efficient industrial production a great emphasis is placed on the ""perfect organization, methods and equipment"" required to achieve the record production accomplished at Amatol. Plant Operation The operation of the loading process is excellently described in the book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. : "" Whether the shell be large or small, it is placed lengthwise on the conveyor belt and moves along at a constant speed to the next process. When it reaches the proper point a workman stationed there simply rolls it off the belt on the bench.

When Elwoodians retired to rest last night they were surrounded by the quiet and calm that have characterized their community since the coming of the first settler. When they awoke today a large force of strangers had landed in their midst; their eyes beheld on the little-used side-track of the West Jersey & Seashore Railroad a half hundred freight cars bearing the legend, “Ordnance Department, U. S. A.,” and heavy motor trucks similarly decorated, chugged noisily about the quiet streets. ``` ```markdown Amazed at the transformation, and, with few exceptions entirely ignorant of its cause, the people immediately began diligent inquiries and were amazed to learn that their town had been chosen as the directing center of a great industrial project, the construction of which will begin tomorrow morning. They learned that the strangers were made up of real estate men, whose work in securing the huge tract on which a shell-loading plant will stand has been practically completed; of construction workers in the employ of the Atlantic Loading Company, of New York, to which has been awarded the work of erecting the plant; and a force of engineers attached to the War Department. ``` ```markdown The Government representatives, they found, had come to talk business, and an hour after they had located Arthur Walker, proprietor of the Griswold Garden Tea Room, a favorite haunt for automobilists, they had bought the building and had begun the work of transforming it into a central office. Daniel B. Frazier, owner of a great part of the tract on which the new war industry will stand, worked diligently with J. B. Manly, of Somers Point, as his agent, among the few owners of the property who were holding out for bigger prices. They had practically completed their task before the day closed, and the word went out tonight that work on the great plant will positively begin tomorrow. Two hundred men will arrive late tonight and this number will be increased to at least 1000 before tomorrow night. ``` ```markdown Options have been secured on the entire town of Elwood, including stores and residences, and the whole hamlet will in all probability be purchased by the big steel company behind the project for housing its thousands of employees during the construction of the plant. Building contractors visited the hamlet during the day, picking out the most desirable sites for barracks for workmen and other structures which will be used while the work of erection is going on. The space on which the plant will be erected, made up for the most part of the Frazier and Jarmlusky tracts, is bounded in triangle shape by Hammonton, Elwood and Indian Mills, comprising several thousand acres. ```']","The context does not mention a shell plant in New York City, but it describes how a large tract of land in New Jersey near Hammonton was transformed into a shell-loading plant during wartime, with significant involvement from New York-based companies and organizations. The connection is that the Atlantic Loading Company, which was involved in the shell plant, was formed by experts from New York, and the project reflects the influence of New York in wartime industrial efforts, even though the plant itself was located in New Jersey.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How did the development and subsequent disappearance of the Amatol munitions factory in New Jersey reflect the United States' wartime efforts during World War I, and what lasting impacts did this have on the local community and historical documentation?","['<1-hop>\n\nSCOPE OF THE WORK In April, 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, and began the work of enlarging the Army and Navy and providing for the needed supply of food, clothing and munitions, its greatest task was to provide for the manufacture of munitions. The needed men were here; it only remained to draft and drill them. Food and clothing were being produced; it only remained to stimulate production. But to provide for an ample supply of munitions new factories had to be built and peacetime works transformed into gun and shell producers.', '<2-hop>\n\nAmatol: A former World War I munitions factory, located in Mullica Township, NJ The Book Shell Loading at Amatol, N.J. (150 scanned pages) is a rare, oversize book that documented the building of a bomb making facility at the tail end of World War I. Amatol was an extensive and attractive ""company town"" to support the ordnance facility. That town of 10,000 disappeared very quickly. However, unlike so many New Jersey ""ghost towns"", this one was fully documented by the company that built it. For anyone familiar with the site Amatol, and later, the wood board Atlantic City Speedway occupied, it is a shock to learn that there had been a large ammunition plant and a supporting town on land that is now covered by mature forest. The only remaining building on the site is the former barracks for the New Jersey State Police located on the White Horse Pike. The people who developed the facility, the factories and storage plants and the town itself comes to life through beautiful photographs in the book and on post-cards capturing a forgotten time. Even though it was a well-produced book, the enthusiasm of readers who have discovered the book has taken their toll on the book. It is the intention of this project to give new life to this wonderful document. Amatol Comes to Life The United States had entered the seemingly endless European war (later called the First World War) on April 6, 1917. In June of 1917 American troops began landing in France. The United States was also increasing its support of materiel for the war effort; one important category was ordnance. In December of 1917 a group of nationally prominent businessmen incorporated the Atlantic Loading Company under the laws of the State of Maine. The effect on local residents is best described in an article from a local newspaper of the time. The March 9, 1918 issue of the South Jersey Republican gives this account of the activity at the site: ""Never in history was Hammonton so stirred up as on Sunday and Monday, when announcement was made that the Government had taken land four miles below here and proposed employing twenty thousand hands to erect buildings and load shells for war purposes. The papers were signed Saturday noon, and Sunday nearly a half hundred army trucks, loaded with tools, lumber and supplies, passed through town to the scene, at East Hammonton, this side of Elwood."" Construction Construction on the plant began March 4, 1918. Two miles away from the plant site , the town that would house the workers, was also constructed. This distance would ensure the safety of the residents from any accidental explosions at the munition plant. This circumstance was dramatically demonstrated in the terrible accident at the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lake Denmark, New Jersey in 1926. Both Amatol and Town-site were complete within nine months time. The plant was designed for safety and redundancy. The plant was laid out so that an explosion in one building should not damage any other buildings. This was accomplished by designing the buildings in such a way that an explosion would move upward rather than outward. Additional protection, in some cases, was provided with soil filled barricades. Hazardous operations were carried out in duplicate buildings so that if one were destroyed in an explosion the entire operation would not be jeopardized.']","The Amatol munitions factory in Mullica Township, New Jersey, was built as part of the United States' extensive wartime effort following the declaration of war on Germany in April 1917, which required the rapid expansion of munitions manufacturing. Construction began in March 1918, and the factory, along with the supporting town designed to house 10,000 workers, was completed within nine months, emphasizing the urgency and scale of the wartime mobilization. The factory's layout prioritized safety, with buildings designed to contain explosions and prevent widespread damage. After the war, the town of Amatol disappeared quickly, leaving behind only a few remaining structures, such as the former barracks. Despite its brief existence, the site was thoroughly documented in photographs and publications, capturing a significant chapter of wartime history. This documentation preserves the memory of the community that supported the war effort and highlights the lasting impact of wartime industrialization on local communities and their historical records.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
"How did the Pennsylvania Railroad facilitate the rapid construction and operation of the shell loading plant near Hammonton, New Jersey, as described in the context of the Atlantic Loading Company’s activities during 1918?","['<1-hop>\n\nThe achievements of 1918 showed how well this work had been done in 1917. Once the lathes and the forges were working it became necessary to supply the high explosives with which to charge the shell they turned out, and to provide extensive machinery for doing the charging. Contracts were made for the production on a vast scale of trinitrotoluol, the destructive explosive used in modern big gun ammunition, and other contracts for the construction of plants for the loading of the shell as fast as the mills turned them out. Four large shell loading plants were projected and eventually placed in operation, namely, those of the Bethlehem Loading Co., the T. A. Gillespie Loading Co., the DuPont Engineering Co. and the Atlantic Loading Company. Of these the plant of the Atlantic Loading Company is the largest. It is located at Amatol, New Jersey—a town which came into being to house its workers, and is about 25 miles from Atlantic City, adjacent to and north of the Pennsylvania and the Reading railroads. The site consists of a tract of approximately 6,000 acres of land, with its western boundary about six miles east of Hammonton, New Jersey. The history of the Atlantic Loading Company is a story of organization, construction and production in quick-step time. It entered into a contract with the Ordnance Department of the Government to act as its agent in loading and storing shell, and it conducted its work and enterprise from first to last in accordance with the rules and regulations of that department. It began the work of construction on its plant on March 4, 1918, began operations the following July, and in August loaded its first shell, and in the meantime it also had built the new town of Amatol. An indication of the high speed with which its operations were conducted may be found in the fact that within twenty-four hours after the site was finally determined upon, actual work on clearing the land for the plant was under way. The enterprise combined two separate and distinct undertakings, either of which in itself would require an organization embracing high skill, initiative and intensive working power. One was the rapid construction of a large shell loading plant, the other the building of a town to provide proper quarters for the thousands of workers whose employment was contemplated. To meet the requirements of the Ordnance Department the plant had to be brought to a producing basis at the earliest day possible, and to do this the town had to be built and made ready to house the workers at the same time. It was in contemplation of this that the Atlantic Loading Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine in December, 1917. The stated purposes of the corporation were: first, to construct and operate a shell loading plant for the production of completed rounds of ammunition and to provide the necessary storage capacity therefor; second, to build a town for the housing of the operatives. The plant was designed to be the largest of its type in the country, providing for the loading of shell of all sizes from 75 mm, to 10-inch drop bombs, depth bombs, rifle grenades, hand grenades and boosters. The charter provisions were very broad, in order to permit the Company to enter into contracts for construction of any and all kinds, such as steam and electric railroads, manufacturing plants, electrical transmission lines, power developments, buildings and bridges.', '<2-hop>\n\nINTRODUCTION BY JAMES BLAINE WALKER Secretary Public Service Commission, 1st Dist. New York; Author of ""Fifty Years of Rapid Transit,"" etc. FOR MANY YEARS travelers on the Pennsylvania Railroad, between Philadelphia and Atlantic City, have viewed from the car windows apparently interminable stretches of flat, sandy country covered with a thick growth of scrub oak, small pine trees and a dense undergrowth of brush. Many have speculated as to what practical use this great stretch of land, useless in its present state for agricultural purposes and yet most advantageously located, could be devoted. Quite unexpectedly the necessities of war brought a large portion of it into practical use. The Atlantic Loading Company, a corporation formed in New York City, entered into a contract with the Government to build and operate a shell loading plant as the agent of the Government. The officers of the company immediately began looking for a site for the contemplated plant, and this section of New Jersey attracted their attention. It was comparatively isolated and yet traversed by important railroad lines which afforded ample transportation facilities for men and materials. The soil was easily worked and there was available a subterranean supply of excellent water readily tapped by driving wells. The moderate, healthful and equable climate was also suitable for a large industrial community. Early in the year 1918 the Company acquired for the Government a tract of 6000 acres of this land lying near the town of Hammonton, New Jersey. The Company began work on March 4th, 1918, and within a few months had cleared the land, laid out and built a new town and an enormous plant, peopled the former with workmen and equipped the latter with machinery and begun the loading of shell. The transformation of the wilderness into a hive of industry within such a short time was one of the many war-time marvels of American engineering achievement. The history of the work is a story of the accomplishment of brain power, engineering talent and the genius of American business organization, which reflects the highest credit upon all concerned. The leaders in the formation of the Atlantic Loading Company were O. J. Salisbury, of Salt Lake City, Utah, J. D. Evans, of the Evans Engineering Corporation, and the Electric Bond and Share Company, of New York, both of whom have had extensive experience in the financing and construction of large works. The new Company was formed by taking the pick of men from several large organizations, including that of the Electric Bond and Share Company, so that each of its men was made up of experts. This method of selecting suitable men was followed throughout the organization, the financial and administrative chiefs as well as the engineers being picked men. The new organization having in its personnel many of the pioneers in the quantity loading of high explosive shell, embodied in its plant at Amatol the best, most economical and safest methods which could be devised for facilitating and speeding up production. Some of these methods were developed by the Company\'s own engineers: the power belt conveyor system, which permits the continuous movement of shell through the various operations within the central loading building, is one feature. The men placed in charge of operating the plant thus brought to the work at Amatol the skill necessary to successful operation. The speed with which the call of the Government was met, the co-ordination of plant and men and the results obtained which provided for every contingency stand out as prominent features of the work.']","The Pennsylvania Railroad played a crucial role in facilitating the rapid construction and operation of the shell loading plant near Hammonton, New Jersey, by providing important transportation facilities that allowed for the efficient movement of men and materials. The location of the plant was chosen partly because it was traversed by significant railroad lines, including the Pennsylvania Railroad, which enabled the quick delivery of supplies and personnel necessary for the extensive industrial development. This connectivity contributed to the transformation of the land into a large-scale industrial site and the building of a new town, Amatol, to house the workers, all within a remarkably short timeframe during 1918.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
