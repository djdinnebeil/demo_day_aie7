MR. GRAHAM. Well, what do you want 6,000 acres for?
COL. HAWKINS. We want a substantial safety zone. We have a townsite and a mile and a half away is the plant itself; and then we want to have a substantial safety zone as a safeguard.
MR. GRAHAM. Col. Hawkins, did you build a town over there?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. How big a town?
COL. HAWKINS. I think for 20,000.
MR. GRAHAM. For 20,000 people?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Built the houses?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes; and the movies.
MR. GRAHAM. Where is it?
COL. HAWKINS. It is 25 miles from Atlantic City.
MR. GRAHAM. Are you running that town at present?
COL. HAWKINS. No; we shut it down, except absolute quarters for the people we have there.
MR. GRAHAM. How many houses did you build there?
COL. HAWKINS. I can show you a complete report on it; the kind of houses and the amount spent and the roads and everything else.
MR. GRAHAM. Do you know approximately how much you spent on that place over there?
COL. HAWKINS. About $14,000,000.
MR. GRAHAM. Well, was that under some order of the Secretary of War, or somebody, that that was done?
COL. HAWKINS. In November, I think it was, of 1917, Gen. Crozier submitted this to the General Staff, and my recollection is that the Secretary of War approved it, but did not approve it in writing. Later on, we got his written approval, in the latter part of 1918.
MR. GRAHAM. From the Secretary of War?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Was it after the armistice?
COL. HAWKINS. No, sir; it was in September of 1918, I should think. But our original submission of the whole scheme was made in November of 1917, and the contracts were let to most of these companies on the 3rd of December, 1917, and the first one in operation that I recollect was the Gillespie Co. loading plant at Morgan, N.J., and the second one in operation was the Atlantic Loading Co. plant and the third the California loading plant; I am unable to state when the Penneman plant got into operation.
MR. GRAHAM. Now, let us see about this loading plant. In times of peace is there any purpose for any such plant?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes; we have to have some loading facilities. We have done a good deal of it by contractors.
MR. GRAHAM. How is that?
COL. HAWKINS. We have done some by contractors and some in our establishments.
MR. GRAHAM. Is it the purpose of the Government to try to run this institution in peace times?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. At Amatol?
COL. HAWKINS. Not on a large basis, but to have a nucleus there to begin with in case we need it.
