FRANKFORD ARSENAL WILL BE EQUIPPED FOR MILLION ROUNDS DAILY 

Small Arms Ammunition of All Types, and Artillery Parts to Be Made 

Special to The Inquirer. INQUIRER BUREAU, 1506 G St., N. W. 

WASHINGTON, April 28.—Frankford Arsenal, at Philadelphia, is to be equipped with the necessary machinery sufficient for the manufacture of one million rounds of small arms ammunition of all types per day of eight hours. 

Twelve other plants will also be enlarged and put into working order. This announcement was made by Acting Secretary of War Crowell. 

The “set up” at Frankford Arsenal will be operated only on a small scale to make such small quantities of ammunition and also to erect additional fabricated government-owned buildings at that place. In this way a plant will be installed for the manufacture, in relatively small quantities, of all metal components for artillery ammunition from one-pounder to 240 millimeter, inclusive.
