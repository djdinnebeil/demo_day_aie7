MR. GRAHAM. Are there any contracts except these two that you have personal knowledge of?
COL. HAWKINS. You have mentioned the plant marked Hammonton; we call that Amatol, N.J.
MR. GRAHAM. Do you know about that personally?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. That is where the Government is acquiring a plant of 6,000 acres?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. A loading plant?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. Loading what?
COL. HAWKINS. Shells; principally 75's.
MR. GRAHAM. Is it finished?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; it was in active operation a year ago.
MR. GRAHAM. Do you know whether they produced any shells there?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; quite a number.
MR. GRAHAM. Do you know how many?
COL. HAWKINS. I do if I can look at one of these reports someplace; it was one of the real live plants; they were slow in getting started.
MR. GRAHAM. How much land did you have there before you acquired this land, 6,000 acres?
COL. HAWKINS. We did not have any; that was a tract acquired from one interest.
MR. GRAHAM. Did you build buildings there?
COL. HAWKINS. We started a plant there in March, 1918, and we went into active operation in July, and very complete operations by the time the armistice was signed. Following that the plant was turned over to the commanding officer and it is now a permanent ordnance plant.
MR. GRAHAM. Is it proposed to keep this permanently?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir; that was turned over to the commanding officer, Col. Miles, and he is doing a certain amount of loading there to-day.
MR. GRAHAM. Loading what; shells?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. How many buildings do you have there?
COL. HAWKINS. I have a very complete map at the office.
MR. GRAHAM. Well, have you built any since the armistice?
COL. HAWKINS. He has not; except a few magazines.
MR. GRAHAM. Did you have the land leased?
COL. HAWKINS. We had a contract with the Atlantic Loading Co., entered into in December of 1918, and one of the provisions of that contract was that the Atlantic Loading Co., our agent, should procure a site for us, for which we would pay them a rental of $100,000 a year, and that rental should apply on the purchase price which we should pay.
MR. GRAHAM. Which you were to pay?
COL. HAWKINS. Yes, sir.
MR. GRAHAM. How much land did they have?
COL. HAWKINS. They had this tract of 6,000 acres which they hadâ€”
