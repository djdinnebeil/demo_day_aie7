Amatol was established in 1918, as a shell loading plant by
the Atlantic Loading Company. The population in 1918 was
7,000, but had decreased to a few hundred in 1920. The sewage
treatment plant was constructed in 1918, and consists of a onestory
sedimentation tank and sand filters. The effluent is discharged
into Lucas Brook, 20.5 miles from the head of Great
Bay.
