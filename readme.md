## 📚 Project Overview

Historians are often asked questions that sound simple—like “When did construction begin at Amatol, NJ?”—but require digging through fragmented sources.  
This project helps them **retrieve accurate answers quickly** with transparent citation and evidence from uploaded historical documents.
